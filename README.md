# 🐱 Spinning Cat Chaos Script

![Spinning Cat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orlyjamie/spinningcat/refs/heads/main/cat.gif)

This repository contains a chaotic JavaScript script that:
- Plays an audio file of a cat song.  
- Spawns spinning cat GIFs all over the page.  
- Flashes a neon green screen intermittently (warning).  
- Makes all elements on the page spin.  

Perfect for XSS demonstrations or just to prank your friends!
